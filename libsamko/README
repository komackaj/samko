This is core library for SAMKO (System for Automated Measurement of Kinetic Objects).
It is aimed to be multiplatform and GUI independent, although most of GUI bussiness logic is implemented here in form of abstract classes. For GUI interfaces see associated projects (e.g. samko-qt)

Dependencies:
  - OpenCV (www.opencv.org) - for various computer vision tasks including digital image processing, minimum version 2.3.3 (lower - especially 2.3.1 - needn't work properly, run samko_unittest to verify)
